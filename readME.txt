Step 1 
Project Finalization
"Walmart Store Sales Prediction"

Step 2 
Analysis of different datasets
Dataset was chosen from kaggle 
Study of finalized dataset for project
Since there was 4 csv files . We mereged them to create a master csv file. Dataframe was loaded using 'Pandas'.

Step 3 
Project flow design was made for fullfilling the requirements for model building
Pre-processing was done by using EDA process 
Data Cleansing part was done & all the missing values were filled.
Correlationship between all the independent variables w.r.t. dependent variables

Project First evaluation  
  
Step 4 
Coloumns showing maximum correlation were chosen for model building.
Different types of visualization was done for dependent & independent variables using various types of grpahs ,plots etc.

Step 5 

Different types of Machine Learning algorithms were studied and among them 6 algorithms selected.
Master dataset was splited into training & testing data & model was built.
Algorithms selected by us was used one by one to get the MAE, MSE& R2 score
Comparison among the results was done & we got to know that XGBoost algorithms gives best results  
We got our final algorithm for prediction & future purpose

Step 6 
User Interface was made using Flask Framework.
From this , we got our result on our local machine 

Project Mid evaluation 

Step 7 
Instance was created on AWS Console 
Deployment was done on AWS.

Step 8 
Project Report was made using final model built.
PowerPoint Presentation was done for project.
Zoom Video was made to explain the project in depth.
